This project accepts input of a city name and outputs a sorted list of major landmarks and tourist destinations in the locality. Further directions include creating a 'scavenger hunt' for tourists to follow, displaying this in a dynamic Google Maps image, and hosting everything on a website. Currently on-hold due to exceeding Google Cloud free tier :(
