# Project Artemis
 
 Project Artemis aims to assist tourists looking for walking tours in new destinations. The program accepts a city name and time constraint, and outputs a custom tour visiting multiple major landmarks and tourist destinations in the city. Project Artemis is written in Python, and uses APIs for web scraping (Travelocity) and Google Maps (Places, Directions, Maps APIs).
 
 Dependencies:
 * Python 3.7.4, numpy, bs4, googlemaps, googlesearch, jupyter
 * Google Maps API Key Required (Active Places, Directions, Maps, Geocoding, and Matrix APIs)

Run using the Jupyter Notebook Standalone file. It might take a few minutes to complete for a larger city.
